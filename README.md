# Formal CV

The format of ***cv-example.json*** is based on schema from: [cv Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).

Copy or modify ***cv-example.json*** with the corresponding data.

Remember to enter ***tsconfig.json*** to set the path value of @cv to that of the file where the cv information is stored.

Idea inspired by the repository: [Bartosz Jarocki - cv](https://github.com/BartoszJarocki/cv).
